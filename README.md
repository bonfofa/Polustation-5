# Polustation-5
Just a replica of the Playstation 5 interface made in WPF, Like the Polustation 4 ( Which you can check here: https://github.com/bonfofa/Polustation-4 ) the project had the same idea

An intuitive interface with buttons that created shortcuts to the application, but for the same reason the project was discontinued and left with just the interface.

 ( Which you can use, just mark my username because I will surely want to see what you will do with this little project: )
